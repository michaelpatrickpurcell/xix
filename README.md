# XIX
An 18-card strategy game for two players.
XIX is intended for players who are at least eight years old.

## Components
  - **Numbered Cards** (18): One card for each whole number between one and eighteen.

## Setup
  1. Shuffle all of the cards together.
  2. Deal six cards face down to each player.
     - You may look at your cards but not your opponent's cards.
  3. Place five cards face down on the table in a single row.
     - This row of cards is called the strike row.
  4. Discard the last card.
     - You will not use this card during the game.

## Playing the Game
A game of XIX consists of a series of exchanges.

Each exchange consists of a series of tricks.

You can win an exchange by taking three tricks or by forcing your opponent to abandon the exchange.
At the end of each exchange, points will be awarded to whoever won the exchange.

After each exchange, you will check to see if the game ends. The game ends if exactly nineteen total points have been awarded or if either player has earned nineteen or more points.

If the game ends because nineteen total points have been awarded, you win if you have fewer points than your opponent. If the game ends because either player has earned nineteen or more points, you win if you have more points than your opponent.

If the game does not end, you will redistribute the cards that were played during the previous exchange via a draft. Then, you will play another exchange.

### Hands
Throughout the game, you will both manage two hands of cards:
  - **Closed Hand**: These cards are kept secret from your opponent. Hold these cards so that you can see the faces of the cards but your opponent cannot.
  - **Open Hand**: These cards are not secret. Place these cards face up on the table in front of you.

You will start the game with the six cards that were dealt to you during the setup in your closed hand.  You will start the game with no cards in your open hand.

You will add the cards that you choose in a draft to your open hand.

### Tricks
You will both play one card in each trick.
You play a card by placing it face up in the middle of the table.
When you play a card, you may play any card from either your closed hand or your open hand.

You should randomly determine which player will lead the first trick (i.e. play the first card) of the game. Thereafter, whoever won the previous trick will lead the next trick.

If the face values of the two cards played in a trick add up to nineteen, then whoever played the card with the lower face value takes the trick. Otherwise, whoever played the card with the higher face value takes the trick.

### Strikes
If you lose a trick then you receive a strike.
After you receive a strike you must do one of the following:
  - **Abandon the Exchange**: You lose the current exchange. Points will be awarded to your opponent.
  - **Raise the Stakes**: Keep playing the current exchange. Increase the number of points that will be awarded to whoever wins the current exchange.

If you receive your third strike in an exchange, you cannot raise the stakes. You must abandon the exchange.

If you lose an exchange, points will be awarded to your opponent.

### Scoring
When you win an exchange, you will be awarded a number of points equal to the current stakes.
The following table describes how the stakes change as a function of the total number of strikes that have been received (by both players) in an exchange.

| Strikes | Stakes|
|---------|--------|
| 1 | 1 |
| 2 | 2 |
| 3 | 3 |
| 4 | 5 |
| 5 | 8 |

### Redistributing Cards
After each each exchange, you will redistribute the cards that were played during that exchange via a draft. You will take turns choosing cards, one at a time, until all of the cards have been chosen.
Whoever lost the previous exchange will choose first.

When you choose a card, add it to your open hand.

After the draft, if you lost the previous exchange then you must trade a card from one of your hands (your hand card) for a card in the strike row (the strike card).

Add the strike card to your one of your hands. If the strike card is face down, add it to your closed hand. Otherwise, add it to your open hand.

Place your hand card in the strike row. If your hand card is in your closed hand, place it face down. If your hand card is in your open hand, place it face up.

Note that your hand card and the strike card must be different cards. You cannot make a "trade" by first adding the strike card to one of your hands and then choosing that same card to be your hand card.

## Tips and Tricks
  - Slide a card from the strike row towards you when you take a strike. This will help you remember how many strikes have been received in the current exchange.

  - Once a card has been played during the game, it will remain face up for the remainder of the game.

  - The first three tricks in each exchange are each worth one point, the fourth trick is worth two points, and the fifth trick is worth three points.
