## Components
  - **Numbered Cards** (18): One card for each whole number between one and eighteen.

## Setup
  1. Shuffle all of the cards together.
  2. Deal six cards face down to each player.
     - You may look at your cards but not your opponent's cards.
  3. Place five cards face down on the table in a single row.
     - This row of cards is called the _strike row_.
  4. Discard the last card.
     - You will not use this card during the game.

## Playing the Game
A game of XIX consists of a series of _exchanges_.

Each exchange consists of a series of _tricks_.
Both players will play one card in each trick.
Each trick will be _taken_ by either you or your opponent.

You can win an exchange by taking three tricks or by forcing your opponent to abandon the exchange.
At the end of each exchange, points will be awarded to the player who won the exchange.

After each exchange, you will check to see if the game ends.

If the game did not end, you will redistribute the cards that were played during the previous exchange via a draft. Then, you will play another exchange as described above.

You win if you have more points than your opponent when the game ends.

### Hands
Throughout the game, both players will mange two hands of cards:
  - **Closed Hand**: These cards are kept secret from your opponent. You should hold these cards so that you can see the faces of the cards but your opponent cannot.
  - **Open Hand**: These cards are not secret. You should hold these cards so that your opponent can see the faces of the cards.

You will begin the game with six cards in your closed hand and zero cards in your open hand.

When you draft cards, you will add the cards that you draft to your open hand.

### Tricks
Both players will play one card in each trick.
You play a card by placing it face up in the middle of the table.
When you play a card, you may play any card from either your closed hand or your open hand.

You should randomly determine which player will _lead_ the first trick (i.e. play the first card) of the game. Thereafter, whoever lost the previous trick will lead the next trick.

If the face values of the two cards played in a trick add up to nineteen, then the second player takes the trick. Otherwise, the player who played the card with the highest face value takes the trick.

### Strikes
If you lose a trick then you receive a _strike_. Choose a card from the strike row and slide it towards you. If the card you choose is face down, you may _peek_ at its face value.

After you receive a strike you must do one of the following:
  - **Abandon the Exchange**: You lose the current exchange. Points will be awarded to your opponent.
  - **Raise the Stakes**: Keep playing the current exchange. Increase the number of points that will be awarded to whoever wins the current exchange.

If you receive your third strike in an exchange, you cannot raise the stakes. You must abandon the exchange.

If you lose an exchange, points will be awarded to your opponent.

### Scoring
The number of points awarded depends on the total number of strikes that have been received during the exchange.

| Strikes | Points |
|---------|--------|
| 1 | 1 |
| 2 | 3 |
| 3 | 6 |
| 4 | 10 |
| 5 | 15 |

### Drafting
After each each exchange, you will redistribute the cards that were played during the previous exchange via a draft. You will take turns choosing cards, one at a time, until all of the cards have been drafted.
If you lost the previous exchange then you will go first.

When you draft a card, add it to your open hand. Once a card has been played during the game, it will remain face up for the remainder of the game.

After the draft, the player who lost the previous exchange must trade a card from one of your hands (your _hand card_) for a card in the strike row (the _strike card_).

Add the strike card to your one of your hands. If the strike card is face down, add it to your closed hand. Otherwise, add it to your open hand.

Place your hand card in the strike row. If your hand card is in your closed hand, then place it face down. If your hand card is from your open hand, then place it face up.

After you have completed the draft, you will play another exchange.
Whoever lost the previous exchange will lead the first trick in the next exchange.

### Ending the Game
After each exchange, you will check to see if the game ends. If all of the cards in the strike row are face up and either player's closed hand is empty, the game ends immediately.
